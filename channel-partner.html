  <h1>Become a Channel Partner</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Elegance Fashion — your gateway to flexible, growth-focused fashion collaboration. We're based in Surat, Gujarat, the textile hub of India, and we're building a pan-India network of individuals passionate about fashion, styling, and entrepreneurship.</p>

  <h2>Our Collaboration Plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plan 1: Resale Collaboration</strong><br/>
      Share our outfits with your network. You set your profit margin and delivery charges — we take care of supply and logistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan 2: On-Demand Sourcing</strong><br/>
      Have someone looking for a specific outfit? We’ll help you source it. You quote the final price including your profit.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan 3: Team Management</strong><br/>
      Onboard and manage a team of collaborators. Guide others working under Plan 1 and 2 while growing your influence and earnings.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan X: Personal Branding & Content</strong><br/>
      Optional plan for those who want to use their own image to promote outfits via social media. This plan pairs well with team management (Plan 3).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Join Us?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Zero investment, full flexibility</li>
    <li>Work from anywhere, at your own pace</li>
    <li>No fixed script — you build your strategy</li>
    <li>Access to exclusive collections not available online</li>
    <li>Opportunities to earn, lead, and build your personal brand</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Still wondering if this is just reselling?</h2>
  <p>We understand — on the surface, it might feel like simple reselling. But our model is much more:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You’re free to pitch your own ideas and strategies</li>
    <li>You set your margins and choose what to promote</li>
    <li>You can manage your own team or even run your own campaign</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In short, this is a collaboration — not a fixed job. You grow with us, at your own pace, your own way.</p>
